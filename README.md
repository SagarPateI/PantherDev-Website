# PantherDev-Website
GitHub repository for the PantherDev Game Development Club website, featuring social media integration, weekly events, an event calendar, and live Twitch streams, with automatic event updates from the official GSU Engage page.

For the time being, this webpage is a static webpage which runs directly from this repository for free. After further development, it may developed into a fully-featured web app which uses a backend.
